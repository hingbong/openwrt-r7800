Subject: [PATCH 434/454] mmc/bcm2835: Recover from MMC_SEND_EXT_CSD

If the user issues an "mmc extcsd read", the SD controller receives
what it thinks is a SEND_IF_COND command with an unexpected data block.
The resulting operations leave the FSM stuck in READWAIT, a state which
persists until the MMC framework resets the controller, by which point
the root filesystem is likely to have been unmounted.

A less heavyweight solution is to detect the condition and nudge the
FSM by asserting the (self-clearing) FORCE_DATA_MODE bit.

N.B. This workaround was essentially discovered by accident and without
a full understanding the inner workings of the controller, so it is
fortunate that the "fix" only modifies error paths.

See: https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/2728
